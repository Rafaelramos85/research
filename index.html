    <p>Active repositories is mainly a developement tool used in a application. This is where most of the source code and information can be stored. But! it is only to compile the app programs. this repository allows for the information to be reused when compiling. also it is a passive repository.

         <p> The purpose of a repository is a central file location. For example GitHub is a repository. you are able to have one area where miltiple different files are store and can be munipulated to what even needs you have. For example for this website, I have a file names Index.html and another calles style.css. each file does something different but are both linked in the same repository which allows them to work together. Using a repository helps many different people or teams with coding because it leaves everything in one nice area that is easy to access. </p>
